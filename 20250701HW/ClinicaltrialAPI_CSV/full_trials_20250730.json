        "briefSummary": "Postprandial meal glucose control with closed-loop systems (CLS) still needs some improvements. In the postprandial period, sensor delay in detecting blood glucose rise after a meal together with delays in insulin absorption expose patients to early risk of hyperglycemia and then to late-postprandial hypoglycemia. Glucagon infusion in dual-hormone CLS has the potential to improve post-meal control as compared to single-hormone CLS allowing a better glucose excursion related to a more aggressive insulin infusion while minimizing hypoglycemic risk. Several approaches have been tested for the determination of prandial boluses during closed-loop operation.\n\nThe objective of this study is to test in outpatient unrestricted settings whether, in the context of closed-loop strategy, conventional meal carbohydrate counting could be reduced to a simplified qualitative meal size estimation without a significant degradation in overall glycemic control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that in outpatient free-living conditions: 1) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to dual-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose; 2) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to single-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose. Secondary hypothesis are: 3) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses will decrease time in hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone CLS with partial boluses; 4) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose; 5) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose."

        "briefSummary": "Metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, including Latin America and Colombia. Asymptomatic elevations of blood glucose, insufficient response to normal insulin concentrations (called insulin resistance), overweight and obesity can cause severe damage to body organs, leading to complications and even death. Worryingly, the prevalence of prediabetes is on the rise and efforts in public health policies made to contain this epidemic have had a very limited impact. This has prompted an intense search for non-pharmacological interventions. One of the most promising areas is research on \"nutraceuticals\", foods capable of positively impacting risk factors. However, there are insufficient nutritional or supplementary alternatives to favorably impact carbohydrate metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals at risk of diabetes. This project will evaluate the effects of the administration of a dietary supplement composed of vegetable oils. The fat composition of these oils is likely to impact positively on the metabolic profile of subjects at risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.",
        "detailedDescription": "Chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 63% of deaths worldwide, of which 80% occur in low- and middle-income countries In Colombia, 71% of all deaths are related to NCDs . This pandemic can be prevented by controlling the risk factors, seeking to create interventions that impact more than one risk factor at a time, including body weight, blood glucose levels, blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness and other relatively minor risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . In its natural history, diabetes is preceded by factors that confer risk of diabetes and for a group of disorders known as \"prediabetes\" term comprising intolerance carbohydrates and impaired fasting glycaemia . Although people at risk of diabetes or prediabetes are often asymptomatic; lesions develop in micro and macrovascular beds and result in long-term kidney dysfunction, retinal damage and affectation of peripheral nerves and arteries. Vascular damage leads to an increased risk of retinopathy renal insufficiency , painful or autonomic neuropathy and atherosclerotic cardiovascular threatening diseases such as acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThe above situation has prompted an intense search for non-pharmacological interventions to intervene in patients at risk of diabetes and prevent negative consequences on the body in the short, medium and long term. One of the most promising areas of research is the nutraceuticals field. Colombian Team Foods S.A has developed a supplement of vegetable oils, that for their composition could have the ability to improve pathophysiological phenomena associated with the development of diabetes and its complications.\n\nThe main objective of this trial is to assess the impact of the consumption of a vegetable oils-based designed jointly by Team Foods and university of los Andes, on several indicators metabolic health in people at risk of diabetes. The specific objectives are:\n\n* To enroll a sample of patients who are at risk of diabetes but have not receive drugs to control plasma glucose, cholesterol or triglycerides, and have not developed complications like kidney or eye dysfunction.\n* To evaluate the effect of daily consumption of the study supplement on fasting blood glucose, the area under the glucose curve in an oral glucose tolerance test, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c-an indicator of blood glucose levels over the last 3 months).\n* To evaluate the effect of the supplement on indexes and biomarkers of insulin resistance.\n* To evaluate the effect of the supplement on other cardiovascular risk factors including lipid profile, blood pressure, body weight and body composition."

        "briefSummary": "While cross-sectional studies have reported a significant association between diabetes and Apical Periodontics, prospective studies are scarce. This will be the first prospective interventional study to explore the cause-and-effect relation between AP and diabetes by assessment of levels of inflammatory markers in a longitudinal setting. Periapical healing in diabetics and nondiabetics will be compared after root canal treatment to evaluate the role of various physical and metabolic attributes on endodontic outcomes.",
        "detailedDescription": "This prospective longitudinal interventional study will be conducted on patients with radiographic evidence of AP in at least one teeth. Total of 280 patients will be selected from the pool of the patients referred to the Outpatient Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. They will be equally divided into two broad groups either without any systemic disease (140 patients) or with type 2 DM.(140 Patients with DM). Each group further divided into 70 patients with AP and 70 control in a systemically healthy group (selected to match participants in age, sex and BMI). Similarly,70 patients with AP and 70 control for participants with type 2 DM will be selected to additionally match with glycaemic control, drugs, and dietary measures apart from other physical attributes.\n\nAnalysis of systemic inflammatory markers IL-1b, IL-6, TNF- α and hsCRP will be done at baseline in both healthy and diabetic participants. Root canal treatment will be done in all the participants with AP and assessment of periapical healing and change in inflammatory markers will be done at 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up.\n\nSample size: Sample size was estimated based on the difference in hsCRP level in patients with AP and healthy control. Effect size of 0.52 was calculated based on the mean difference and pooled SD of 0.91 and 1.75 respectively. Sample size of 58 per group was obtained at 80% power and 0.05 alpha level. Anticipating 20% dropout, total 70 patients per group (in 4 groups total 280 patients)will be recruited.\n\nRoot Canal treatment Access opening will be done after rubber dam isolation and administration of local anesthesia.\n\ndebridement of the pulp chamber will be done and all canal orifices will be identified.\n\nNegotiation of canals will be done. Working length will be determined using root ZX apex locator and will be verified radiographically. Root canal treatment will be performed with protaper rotary instrument using standard protocol. Coronal 2/3rd pre-enlargement will be performed with S1 and S2 files and apical third will be prepared with S1 followed by S2 and suitable finishing files depending on the size of apical binding file. Irrigation will be carried out using 5 mL of a 5% NaOCl solution between files. After preparation, the root canals will be irrigated with 5 mL 17% EDTA for 3 minutes to remove smear layer, followed by 5 mL 5% NaOCl. The final irrigation will be done with 5 mL distilled water. Intracanal dressing of Calcium hydroxide will be applied for 7 days and obturation of canal will be performed after 7 days on 2nd visit. The root canals will be dried using paper points and filled with laterally condensed gutta-percha (Dentsply Maillefer) and AH plus resin-after manipulation following manufacturers' instructions. Gutta- percha will be cut with a heated instrument and vertically condensed right at the orifice opening of the canals. Final composite resin restoration will be performed following manufacturer instruction. All the posterior teeth will be metal/ceramic crown after the completion of root canal treatment.\n\nFollow up Follow-up and clinical and radiographic examinations will be carried out after every three months for one year. Glycaemic control in diabetes patients will also be evaluated by HbA1c values at each follow-up interval."

        "briefSummary": "There is currently no published algorithm for secondary prevention prognosis of CHD that is representative of the England GP-registered population and that includes both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (as identified through primary care). In this paper the investigators will exploit routinely collected information in clinical practice to model CHD prognosis based on a large contemporary open cohort of stable CAD patients. Although the investigators model is based on data from GP practices in England only, the investigators believe that this population is sufficiently heterogeneous in terms of ethnic mix, socioeconomic background, predisposing characteristics and lifestyles to generate a prognostic model with good generalizing power to the wider population.\n\nAmong the research questions the investigators will try to answer is whether established risk factors for primary care prevention (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes) are also reliable for risk-stratification of patients who have already developed CAD. Similarly, the investigators will examine whether strong predictors of adverse outcomes in ACS patients in the short term, such as admission SBP and heart rate, are also associated with their long term prognosis.",
        "detailedDescription": "Objectives\n\n1. To use routinely collected primary care and clinical audit (MINAP) data for patients in England to develop and validate prognostic models for people with stable CAD.\n2. To identify key prognostic factors for progression to MI or fatal CHD and compare their strength among clinically important subgroups.\n3. To estimate the risk distribution to specific time horizons overall and within clinically important subgroups.\n4. To use estimates derived from the model to inform subsequent decision models relating to e.g. selection of patients for CABG or second-line anti-platelet agents (e.g. clopidogrel).\n\nThe outcome of primary interest is fatal CHD \\& non-fatal MI. As a secondary outcome we will model all cause mortality. Incidence for these endpoints will be estimated over a period of up to 5 years depending on the quality and availability of follow-up in the cohort. We may cautiously extend to other endpoints, including CVD and endpoints that reflect symptomatic status (e.g. nitrate use).\n\nWe plan to follow the reporting guidelines set out in the forthcoming work led by Atman and Moons.\n\nData and methods\n\nData sources\n\nInformation will be extracted from the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke studies and electronic records) study. CALIBER is a collection of public health data repositories, linking the national myocardial infarction register to the rich longitudinal primary care record, secondary care data sources and to highly phenotyped cohorts in the UCL genetics consortium. Currently, the CALIBER dataset is composed by linkage of several datasets:\n\n* General Practice Research Database (GPRD)7\n* Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP)8\n* Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)9\n* Mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)\n\nSetting and study population\n\nEligible general practices were defined as practices that meet standards for acceptable levels of data recording (i.e. audits demonstrated that \"at least 95% of relevant patient encounters are recorded and data meet quality standards for epidemiological research\"7), and have consented to linkage with HES and MINAP (approximately 200 practices).\n\nTo define incident cases we will exclude patients who have not been observed during the year prior to their CAD diagnosis date. For prevalent cases we will remove this condition.\n\nOur startpoint population is defined as patients aged 18 years or over diagnosed with CAD, under which we include:\n\n1. patients diagnosed with stable angina\n2. patients with ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI \\& unstable angina) who survived \\> 4 weeks. Patients with a CAD diagnosis who received revascularization during follow-up will enter the cohort after the procedure (given post-procedure survival \\>4 weeks).\n\nWe will cautiously define broader as well as more specific startpoint populations so as to fully exploit the information quantity and richness in the CALIBER data. Thus, we will extend our analysis to prevalent CAD cases and to incident cohorts with one of the four CAD subtypes (stable angina, unstable angina, STEMI and NSTEMI).\n\nThe study start date will be defined as 1st January 2000, in order to include only those patients for whom cause-specific mortality data is potentially available (first linked 1st January 2001). The study period will end on 20th October, 2009, the last date of linkage with ONS mortality data.\n\nFor each patient we will determine the right censor date, which will be the earliest of the following dates: date of developing the outcome of interest, the end of study period (20 October 2009), date of non-coronary death, date of leaving the practice, or last practice data collection date.\n\nEthics\n\nThe study uses anonymised dataset from the GPRD, MINAP and HES. The study protocol was evaluated and approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (ISAC protocol Nos 07-008 and 10-106). The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration No TBC).\n\nExplanatory factors considered Initially, we will consider a wide range of risk factors and biomarkers that have been implicated in coronary artery syndromes and are broadly available at/around the time of a clinical review, including Framingham (\"standard\") risk factors (age, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes). Because, typically, risk factors are not measured concurrently but over a few days around the time of diagnosis we will define rules to select 'baseline' measurements and handle conflicts in overlapping values between GPRD and MINAP (where these arise).\n\nOur selection will be drawn from:\n\n1. demographic, including age at diagnosis, ethnicity and the index of multiple deprivation (IMD)\n2. lifestyle, including smoking and alcohol consumption\n3. blood pressure-related, including SBP, DBP, prescription of anti-hypertensives, diagnosed hypertension, pulse rate and pulse pressure\n4. lipids-related, including total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides and prescription of statins\n5. diabetes-related, including diagnosis of type I or II diabetes, diabetes medication, fasting plasma glucose, Hb1Ac and BMI\n6. biomarkers, including creatinine and haemoglobin\n7. Secondary prevention medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers)\n8. Previous interventions (PCI and CABG)\n9. CVD severity, including angiographic findings (normal/abnormal left ventricular function), CV-coexisting conditions (stroke, peripheral artery disease) previous MI and consultation frequency (within the last year)\n10. Non-CV co-morbidities, major chapters included in the Charlson index\n11. For ACS patients we will also consider information specifically recorded in MINAP in relation to the hospital episode (acute pulse rate, acute SBP and DBP and beta-troponin).\n\nTreatment of missing values\n\nWhere possible, repeated measurements will be used to replace missing data in the baseline record. The approach will be based on a set of rules for transferring measurements between different consultations and reconciling measurements from different sources that we will develop for the CALIBER project.\n\nThe remaining missing values will be replaced with predicted values under the multiple imputation framework, as implemented in the R package 'mice' (version 2). This version of 'mice' can handle both missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) patterns.\n\nTo identify suitable models for imputing each variable we will take the following approach:\n\n* compute the correlation matrix to select strong predictors for the missing data in each variable\n* assess missing data patterns, proportion and covariate distributions\n* identify the strength of association with outcome of interest (fitting a Cox model with all variables)\n* identify a suitable imputation model and simplify it where possible (but always include standard risk factors and any other predictors we expect to include in the prognostic model based on their clinical importance)\n* decide the order in which the variables would be imputed (e.g. in order of decreasing missingness, correlation and/or predictive power).\n\nAll our imputation models will include the outcome of interest (CHD death or non-fatal MI) as previously described 10.\n\nImputation will form part of variable selection and model estimation as described later.\n\nVariable selection\n\nWe will select our final model based on a combination of approaches including statistical performance and clinical feasibility. Our aim is to arrive at a generalizable, efficiently estimable model that, at the same time, is sensitive enough to capture much of the heterogeneity in the target population.\n\nWe will assess statistical performance in CoxPH models with the outcome(s) of interest. Sex will be included as an adjusted or stratifying variable depending on whether or not the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is satisfied.\n\nIt is possible that patients from different practices differ in their underlying risk (e.g. due to regional variations in case-mix). Hence, we will test the PH assumption with respect to sex-specific baseline hazards of the GP practices in the data. If the PH assumption is violated we will estimate Cox models within each practice and combine coefficients by random effects meta-analysis. If the PH assumption is satisfied we will assume the same baseline hazard across practices and indicate the clustered patients (in the same GP practice) in the model to estimate robust variances.\n\nWe will choose the timescale for the Cox models based on preliminary analysis exploring two alternatives, age-at-risk or time to event/censoring. Our choice will be based largely on the age-spread of diagnosis and cases in the cohort and which timescale is more likely to have fewer PH violations.\n\nIn step 1 we will explore univariate associations between each candidate predictor and the primary endpoint in terms of the strength and shape of association and evaluate plausible interactions with age, time and sex. Where the shape differs significantly from linearity we will consider more flexible modelling, such as using restricted-cubic splines. Proportional hazards will be assessed by examining Schoenfield residuals. Variables with low statistical significance will not be considered further unless there are strong clinical reasons.\n\nIn step 2 we will follow a data-driven approach to identify important variables among those retained from step 1 in a multivariate context. For this we will use stepwise regression, as implemented in the fastbw function in the 'rms' R package (ref), forcing into all candidate models the standard risk factors. We will apply the algorithm separately for each panel of candidate predictors, e.g. blood pressure variables, CVD severity etc so as to ensure that at least 1 predictor from each group is represented in the final model. As a general rule p\\>0.1 and lack of strong association in the univariate setting will be considered evidence for exclusion.\n\nThe steps above will be coupled with multiple imputation, as previously recommended11, using an efficient and unbiased approach among the options proposed for the problem at hand. Final selection will be based on assessing several candidate models with similar statistical performance using other criteria, such as the proportion of non-imputed data, measurement reliability, clinical feasibility and clinicians' advice.\n\nOnce variables to be included in the model have been selected we will update imputation models (where necessary) to include these variables. Not doing so could bias associations to null12.\n\nEstimation\n\nEstimation of coefficients and risks needs to incorporate three types of uncertainty:\n\n* Uncertainty due to imputation of missing data (dealt with by incorporating between-imputation variation)\n* Uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters (dealt with by cross-validation)\n* Sensitivity to data sample (dealt with by bootstrapping the data)\n\nTo perform 10-fold cross-validation the data will be randomly divided into 10 subgroups. The risks for individuals in subgroup q will be estimated by fitting the Cox model to all subgroups except subgroup q. Repeating this for each subgroup q=1,..,10 yields predicted risks for all individuals. As a sensitivity analysis we will repeat the cross-validation procedure splitting by GP-practice instead of randomly across all practices.\n\nEstimation will proceed as follows:\n\n1. All predictors selected to be in the final model that have missing data will be imputed based on the imputation models selected in earlier steps.\n2. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for the endpoint of interest treating non-CHD deaths as censored observations.\n3. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for non-CHD treating MI and fatal CHD as censored observations.\n4. Risks will be estimated for each individual adjusting for non-CHD mortality based on the cause-specific Cox models and the formula described by Kalbfleisch \\& Prentice13.\n5. Standard errors will be obtained by repeating steps 2 to 4 on a suitable number (200) of bootstrap samples.\n6. The procedure will be repeated from step 1 for another 4 rounds of imputation to obtain the between imputation variance.\n7. Estimates will be combined using Rubin's rules. Evaluation Most standard methods for model evaluation assume absolute risks (not adjusted for competing risks). Because we are dealing with cumulative incidences (i.e. risks adjusted for non-CVD mortality) we will modify evaluation approaches accordingly.\n\n   * Calibration will be checked by grouping predictions into deciles and computing the mean risk within each decile against the competing risks-adjusted Kaplan-Meier (i.e. cumulative incidence) for that risk group.\n   * Discrimination will be checked overall and in an age-specific manner using a formulation of the C-index that allows adjusting for competing risks14.\n\nFinally, we will compare performance (where possible) with other published risk algorithms, such as GRACE15 and REACH3 that refer to similar starting populations and outcomes. To do this, we will fit models using the set of covariates included in the published algorithms and compare them with our proposed new model. Because no clinically meaningful risk thresholds exist for secondary CHD prevention as yet we will use metrics that do not require risk stratification. Possible examples are the continuous NRI16 and the Brier score.\n\nStatistical software and version\n\nR version 13.1 with appropriate add-on packages."
